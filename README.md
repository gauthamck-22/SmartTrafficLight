# SmartTrafficLight
A c program implementation of a real time traffic light stimulation with the person/ pedestrian control and emergency override.

# Features:
* Multi-lane traffic light system (North-South, East-West).
* Timer-based light changes (Red, Yellow, Green).
* Pedestrian crossing simulation.
* Emergency vehicle override.
* ASCII-based console visualization.

# Potential Extensions:

* Key-press driven pedestrian requests
* Graphical output using SDL2
* Logging and traffic analytics

# Main Use
It simulates a real-world traffic light system with pedestrian crossing and emergency-vehicle control — helping understand embedded systems, real-time decision logic, and automation.

# Key Uses

1. Traffic Management Simulation

Models how traffic lights change (Red → Green → Yellow) in real time.
Can simulate multiple lanes and pedestrian buttons.

2. Pedestrian Safety

Shows how pedestrian signals work with timed delays and button presses.
Useful to demonstrate human–machine interaction.

3. Emergency Vehicle Override

When an emergency vehicle (like an ambulance) is detected, the system gives it priority.
Demonstrates smart-city and IoT concepts.
